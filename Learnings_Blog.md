# PostgreSQL vs ClickHouse: What I Learned From My First Database Benchmark

My first query against 10 million rows in ClickHouse took 4,191 milliseconds. My last took 75. The difference wasn't a new server or additional memory‚Äîit was a single line that revealed my complete misunderstanding of how columnar databases work.

Working at a company that builds OLAP tools means I hear about ClickHouse performance daily. Everyone talks about how much faster it is than traditional databases for analytics. But as a product manager with 8 years in data, I've learned there's a difference between hearing about something and actually understanding it. I was curious enough to dig deeper into what those implementation differences actually looked like, and LLMs have helped me venture much further into technical territory than my traditional PM role typically allows.

So I built this benchmark with a specific question in mind: **How would an AI agent query these databases during a conversation?** I wanted to understand not just that ClickHouse is faster for analytics, but when it matters, why it works, and what the code actually looks like when you're trying to make it perform. What I discovered was a journey of mistakes, fixes, and insights that fundamentally changed how I think about database selection.

## How I Tested This

To make the comparison fair, I set up PostgreSQL and ClickHouse on identical Docker containers‚Äîeach with 4GB RAM and 2 CPUs on my M3 Pro. The dataset was 46 columns of aircraft tracking data, ranging from 10,000 to 10 million records. Every test ran 100 iterations with proper cache warmup to ensure I wasn't measuring random fluctuations.

The workload itself was designed to simulate how an AI agent might progressively explore unfamiliar data: first discovering the schema, then sampling records, followed by time-bucketed aggregations, and finally statistical calculations. This felt more realistic than running isolated queries‚Äîit's how conversations with data actually unfold.

*You can find the full methodology and reproducible setup in [BENCHMARK_METHODOLOGY.md](BENCHMARK_METHODOLOGY.md) if you want to run this yourself.*

## The Short Version

I expected ClickHouse to be "faster." What I discovered was that my first attempt was 55x slower than it should have been because I treated an OLAP database like an OLTP one. Once I fixed my schema design, ClickHouse was indeed 16.8x faster on my 10 million row analytical workload‚Äîbut PostgreSQL actually won on smaller datasets. The most surprising insight wasn't about raw performance; it was that traditional barriers to specialized databases become much more manageable with LLM assistance, completely changing the cost/benefit calculation for when to use OLAP systems.

### The Workload: LLM-Style Data Exploration

Here's what a typical AI-assisted data exploration looks like. Imagine asking Claude: *"Help me understand this aircraft tracking dataset"*

**Claude would naturally progress through these queries:**

```sql
-- Q1: "What tables do we have?"
SHOW TABLES;

-- Q2: "Show me what the data looks like"
SELECT * FROM performance_test LIMIT 10;

-- Q3: "How many unique aircraft do we see each hour?"
SELECT 
  toStartOfHour(timestamp) AS hour,
  uniq(hex) AS unique_aircraft_count
FROM performance_test 
WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour;

-- Q4: "What's the average altitude during those periods?"
SELECT 
  toStartOfHour(timestamp) AS hour,
  uniq(hex) AS unique_aircraft_count,
  avg(alt_baro) AS avg_altitude
FROM performance_test 
WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-01'
  AND alt_baro_is_ground = 0
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour;
```

This progression from schema discovery ‚Üí sampling ‚Üí aggregation ‚Üí statistical analysis mirrors how developers actually explore unfamiliar data with AI assistance.

## The Results: 50K Row Crossover Point

![PostgreSQL vs ClickHouse Crossover Diagram](visualization/crossover_diagram.svg)

| Dataset Size | ClickHouse | PostgreSQL | PG+Index | Winner |
|--------------|------------|------------|----------|--------|
| **10K**      | 27.9ms     | 16.6ms     | 12.9ms   | PG+Idx (2.2x) |
| **50K**      | 75.5ms     | 87.0ms     | 60.5ms   | ~Equal |
| **1M**       | 121.1ms    | 974.1ms    | 1,067ms  | CH (8.8x) |
| **10M**      | 453ms      | 12,201ms   | 7,595ms  | **CH (16.8x)** |

*Times represent the full 4-query analytical workload: schema discovery, data sampling, aggregation, and statistical calculation.*

**Key insight**: PostgreSQL wins on small datasets (lower overhead). ClickHouse dominates once columnar benefits outweigh setup costs. The crossover matters for architecture decisions.

## Learning #1: ORDER BY = Physical Storage (Not Just Sorting)

This was my biggest "aha!" moment, and it perfectly illustrates why understanding database internals matters.

### The Disaster: My First Schema

I approached ClickHouse like PostgreSQL. "Let's store data chronologically," I thought:

```sql
-- My naive ClickHouse schema (commit 710212a)
CREATE TABLE performance_test (
  timestamp DateTime,
  hex String,
  alt_baro Int32,
  alt_baro_is_ground UInt8,
  -- ... 42 more columns
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (timestamp, hex);  -- "Logical" chronological order
```

When I ran my analytical query, disaster struck:

```sql
-- The query that took 4,191ms
SELECT 
  toStartOfHour(timestamp) AS hour,
  uniq(hex) AS unique_aircraft_count,
  avg(alt_baro) AS avg_altitude
FROM performance_test 
WHERE alt_baro_is_ground = 0  -- Filter out ground readings
  AND timestamp >= '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY hour;
```

**4,191 milliseconds.** For 10 million rows, that's painful.

### The Schema Fix

I asked Claude about the slow query performance: *"ClickHouse query taking 4+ seconds on 10M rows. Schema and query attached - what's wrong?"*

**"Your ORDER BY doesn't match your query pattern. You're filtering on `alt_baro_is_ground` but it's not first in your primary key. ClickHouse has to scan the entire dataset."**

The fix was embarrassingly simple:

```sql
-- The corrected schema (commit 8924b53)  
CREATE TABLE performance_test (
  -- Same columns...
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (alt_baro_is_ground, hex, timestamp);  -- Filter column FIRST
```

**Same query, same data: 75ms.** A **55x improvement** from changing one line.

### Why This Matters: Physical vs Logical Storage

Here's the fundamental difference I missed:

**PostgreSQL approach (what I did wrong):**
```sql
-- ORDER BY is just for output sorting
SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY timestamp;

-- Indexes are separate from storage order
CREATE INDEX idx_filter ON table(alt_baro_is_ground);
CREATE INDEX idx_composite ON table(alt_baro_is_ground, timestamp);
```

**ClickHouse reality (what I learned):**
```sql
-- ORDER BY defines PHYSICAL storage on disk
ORDER BY (alt_baro_is_ground, hex, timestamp);

-- This means:
-- 1. All alt_baro_is_ground=0 rows stored together
-- 2. Within each group, hex values clustered  
-- 3. Query performance depends ENTIRELY on this choice
```

### The Visual Difference

**Bad ORDER BY (timestamp, hex):**
```
Disk blocks: [mixed data][mixed data][mixed data][mixed data]
Query needs: Scan ALL blocks to find alt_baro_is_ground=0
```

**Good ORDER BY (alt_baro_is_ground, hex, timestamp):**
```
Disk blocks: [ground=1][ground=1][ground=0][ground=0][ground=0]
Query needs: Skip first blocks, read only [ground=0] blocks
```

### The Trade-off: Flexibility vs Performance

This revealed a fundamental architectural difference:

> **PostgreSQL philosophy:** "I don't know what queries you'll run, so I'll create multiple indexes to handle various patterns."
> - ‚úÖ Flexible: handles any query pattern reasonably well
> - ‚ùå Storage overhead: indexes take space and slow inserts
> - ‚ùå Not optimal: rarely the fastest for any specific pattern

> **ClickHouse philosophy:** "Tell me your primary query pattern upfront, and I'll organize everything for maximum speed."
> - ‚úÖ Blazing fast: optimal performance for the chosen pattern  
> - ‚ùå Commitment required: hard to change after data is loaded
> - ‚ùå Can be terrible: wrong ORDER BY = disaster

### Memory Implications

When I tested this with reduced memory (2GB vs 4GB), the ORDER BY choice became even more critical. ClickHouse failed completely during bulk inserts at 2GB - it needs substantial memory to sort and compress data during loading. But once loaded, queries ran efficiently at any memory level.

*This wasn't optimization - this was fixing a fundamentally broken OLAP schema design.*

## Learning #2: Bulk Loading Architectures Differ Completely

Nothing taught me more about database architecture than trying to load 10 million records efficiently. What started as a simple task became a deep dive into how these systems handle data differently.

### The Performance Journey

**Phase 1: Individual inserts**
```javascript
for (const record of records) {
  await client.query('INSERT INTO table VALUES (...)', record);
}
```
*Projected time: 7.5 hours for 10M records*

**Phase 2: Basic batching (size: 100)**
*Result: 80 minutes*

**Phase 3: Parameter limit optimization**
I asked Claude: *"What's the optimal PostgreSQL batch size for 46 columns?"*
**"PostgreSQL's parameter limit is 65,535. You can batch ~1,400 records instead of 100."**
*Result: 30 minutes*

**Phase 4: Parallel workers**
*Result: 18 minutes (25x improvement from Phase 1)*

### The ClickHouse Surprise

Here's where things got interesting. When I applied the same parallel worker approach to ClickHouse:

```javascript
// Same parallel approach for ClickHouse
// Expected: Major speedup
// Actual result: Minimal improvement (57.3K ‚Üí 54.8K records/sec)
```

**Why?** ClickHouse's columnar engine is already internally optimized for bulk operations. Adding client-side parallelism actually created overhead rather than improvement.

### The Architecture Revelation

This experience revealed a fundamental difference in how these systems handle concurrency:

**üü¶ PostgreSQL (OLTP) Philosophy:**

```

### The Visual Performance Journey

![Bulk Loading Performance Journey](visualization/bulk_loading_performance.svg)

Here's how the performance improved with each phase:

```
Phase 1: [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà] 7.5 hours

Phase 4: [‚ñà‚ñà] 18 minutes ‚Üê PostgreSQL winner

ClickHouse: [‚ñà] 13 minutes (single-threaded optimal)
```

### The Memory Trade-off

This architectural difference extends to memory usage. PostgreSQL can perform bulk inserts with limited memory by processing rows incrementally. ClickHouse requires substantial memory during bulk operations to buffer, sort, and compress data for optimal columnar storage.

**The lesson:** OLTP databases benefit from client-side parallelism because they're designed for concurrent operations. OLAP databases are already internally parallelized for the operations they're optimized for.

## Learning #3: Type Precision Affects Performance Differently

ClickHouse performance depends heavily on using precise types. PostgreSQL is more forgiving.

### Initial Schema: Generic Types

I started with generic types in both databases:

```sql
-- PostgreSQL schema
CREATE TABLE performance_test (
  lat DOUBLE PRECISION,
  alt_baro DOUBLE PRECISION,  
  hex VARCHAR(6),
  approach BOOLEAN,
  transponder_type VARCHAR(50)
);

-- ClickHouse schema (initial)
CREATE TABLE performance_test (
  lat Float64,
  alt_baro Int32,
  hex String,              -- Variable-length string
  approach UInt8,
  transponder_type String  -- Variable-length string
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (alt_baro_is_ground, hex, timestamp);
```

### LLM-Optimized Schema

I asked Claude: *"How should I optimize ClickHouse types for this aircraft tracking schema?"*

**"Use FixedString for hex codes (always 6 chars), LowCardinality for transponder_type (few unique values), and precise numeric types to minimize storage."**

```sql
-- ClickHouse schema (optimized)
CREATE TABLE performance_test (
  lat Float64,                              -- Sufficient precision
  alt_baro Int32,                          -- 32-bit range adequate
  hex FixedString(6),                      -- Always exactly 6 characters
  approach UInt8,                          -- 1 byte boolean
  transponder_type LowCardinality(String)  -- Dictionary encoding for ~20 unique values
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (alt_baro_is_ground, hex, timestamp);
```

### Performance Impact

Testing with 5M records:

**Storage:**
- Generic types: 2.1 GB
- Optimized types: 1.8 GB (15% reduction)

**Query performance:**
- Generic types: 127ms average
- Optimized types: 109ms average (10-15% improvement)

### Why This Works

**ClickHouse columnar storage benefits:**
```

**LowCardinality optimization:**

```

### The Development Speed Trade-off

**Traditional approach:** Research ClickHouse documentation, understand compression algorithms, test different type combinations.
**Time:** Hours to days.

**LLM-assisted approach:** Describe the data, ask for optimal types, get explanation of why.
**Time:** Minutes.

**Result:** LLMs remove the expertise barrier for database-specific optimizations without sacrificing performance.

## Learning #4: Native Functions vs Standard SQL

Database-specific functions often perform significantly better than generic SQL.

### Unique Count Comparison

![Function Performance Comparison](visualization/function_comparison.svg)

Testing unique aircraft count on 5M records:

**PostgreSQL (exact count):**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT hex) FROM performance_test;
-- Result: 4,847 aircraft (exact)
-- Time: 2,606ms
```
*Documentation: [PostgreSQL Aggregate Functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html)*

**ClickHouse (approximate count):**
```sql  
SELECT uniq(hex) FROM performance_test;
-- Result: 4,851 aircraft (0.08% error)
-- Time: 61ms (40x faster)
```
*Documentation: [ClickHouse uniq() Function](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/aggregate-functions/reference/uniq)*

### Date Function Comparison

**PostgreSQL:**
```sql
SELECT date_trunc('hour', timestamp), COUNT(*) 
FROM performance_test 
GROUP BY date_trunc('hour', timestamp);
-- Standard SQL function
```

**ClickHouse:**
```sql
SELECT toStartOfHour(timestamp), COUNT(*)
FROM performance_test 
GROUP BY toStartOfHour(timestamp);
-- Native function, 20-30% faster
```

### When to Use Approximation

I asked Claude: *"When is ClickHouse's uniq() approximation acceptable vs uniqExact()?"*

**"Use uniq() for analytics dashboards, user behavior analysis, capacity planning. Use uniqExact() for financial reports, compliance, billing, or when exactness is legally required."**

### The Accuracy vs Speed Trade-off

**ClickHouse approximation algorithms:**
```
uniq() - HyperLogLog algorithm
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Speed: Very fast
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Memory: Low (fixed size)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Accuracy: 99%+ for most data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Use case: Analytics, monitoring

uniqExact() - Exact counting
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Speed: Slower (similar to PostgreSQL)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Memory: High (grows with cardinality)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Accuracy: 100%
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Use case: Financial, legal, billing
```

### Function Discovery Through LLMs

**Traditional approach:** Read documentation, search Stack Overflow, test different functions.

**LLM approach:** *"What's the ClickHouse equivalent of PostgreSQL's date_trunc for hourly grouping?"*

Response: **"Use toStartOfHour(). It's optimized for ClickHouse's columnar storage and typically 20-30% faster than generic date functions."**

**Result:** Native functions provide measurable performance gains, and LLMs make them discoverable without deep database expertise.

## Learning #5: NULL Handling Philosophy

OLAP and OLTP databases handle missing data differently by design.

### Schema Design Differences

**ClickHouse approach (performance-first):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE performance_test (
  nav_qnh UInt16 DEFAULT 0,           -- Missing data = 0
  nav_altitude_mcp UInt16 DEFAULT 0,  -- Missing data = 0
  nav_heading UInt16 DEFAULT 0        -- Missing data = 0
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (alt_baro_is_ground, hex, timestamp);
```

**PostgreSQL approach (semantics-first):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE performance_test (
  nav_qnh DOUBLE PRECISION,           -- Missing data = NULL
  nav_altitude_mcp DOUBLE PRECISION,  -- Missing data = NULL
  nav_heading DOUBLE PRECISION        -- Missing data = NULL
);
```

### Query Result Differences

Same dataset, different results:

```sql
-- Test data: [1, 2, missing_value, 4]

-- PostgreSQL query
SELECT AVG(nav_qnh) FROM performance_test;
-- Result: 2.33 (excludes NULL from calculation)
-- Logic: (1 + 2 + 4) / 3 = 2.33

-- ClickHouse query  
SELECT AVG(nav_qnh) FROM performance_test;
-- Result: 1.75 (includes zero in calculation)
-- Logic: (1 + 2 + 0 + 4) / 4 = 1.75
```

### Why ClickHouse Uses Default Values

**Performance benefits:**
```

‚îÇ    NULL     ‚îÇ      1      ‚îÇ

Default value storage:
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ    Data     ‚îÇ ‚Üê No additional overhead

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

**Compression efficiency:**
- Columns with default values compress better
- No NULL checking in aggregate functions
- Vectorized operations run faster

### When This Matters

**OLAP use cases where defaults work:**
- Event counting (no event = 0 events)
- Metrics aggregation (missing metric = 0)
- Time series analysis (missing data point = 0)

**OLTP use cases where NULLs are needed:**
- User profile fields (missing = unknown, not zero)
- Financial transactions (missing amount ‚â† $0)
- Optional form fields (blank ‚â† zero)

### The Trade-off

**ClickHouse:** Sacrifices semantic precision for performance and compression.
**PostgreSQL:** Preserves semantic meaning at the cost of storage and computational overhead.

**Result:** Neither approach is wrong - they optimize for different priorities.

## The LLM Advantage

Traditional OLAP optimization required weeks of documentation reading and months of trial and error. LLMs compress this to minutes of guided questions and explanations.

**Examples from this project:**
- Schema optimization: 15% storage reduction in 30 seconds
- Query fix: 55x performance improvement from one-line change  
- Function selection: 20-30% performance gain from native functions
- Bulk loading: 25x improvement from parameter limit knowledge

## Conclusion

Database selection traditionally required deep expertise to realize performance benefits. LLMs change this by making database-specific optimizations accessible through guided conversations rather than research projects.

**When to choose what:**
- **<50K rows:** PostgreSQL (lower overhead)
- **>50K rows:** ClickHouse for analytics (columnar benefits emerge)
- **>1M rows:** ClickHouse strongly preferred (significant performance gap)

**The practical impact:** Specialized databases like ClickHouse provide measurable performance advantages that become accessible through LLM-assisted development. The traditional expertise barrier is lowered, making OLAP systems viable for a broader range of projects.
